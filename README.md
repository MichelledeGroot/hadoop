# RHadoop with Mapreduce
This R script is able to show the average price of avocados for each season.
It utilises RHadoop and mapreduce to manipulate data in a hadoop environment.

## Setup
Run this line in the script.
"install.packages(c("rJava", "Rcpp", "RJSONIO", "bitops", "digest", 
                   "functional", "stringr", "plyr", "reshape2", "dplyr", 
                   "R.methodsS3", "caTools", "Hmisc"))"
                   
This should install all the packages needed for rhdfs and rmr2.
Then the script is ready to go.
